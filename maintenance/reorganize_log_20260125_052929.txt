[05:29:32] SUMMARY:
[05:29:32]   Topic directories created: 20
[05:29:32]   Files migrated: 17
[05:29:32]   Migration failures: 0
[05:29:32]   Hardware directories: 6
[05:29:32] 
[05:29:32] NEXT STEPS:
[05:29:32] 1. Review the new structure:
[05:29:32]    explorer learning_new
[05:29:32] 
[05:29:32] 2. If satisfied, finalize:
[05:29:32]    Remove-Item src\learning -Recurse -Force
[05:29:32]    Rename-Item learning learning_old_backup
[05:29:32]    Rename-Item learning_new learning
[05:29:32] 
[05:29:32] 3. Commit to Git:
[05:29:33]    git add -A
[05:29:33]    git status
[05:29:33]    git commit -m 'Reorganize to topic-based learning structure'
