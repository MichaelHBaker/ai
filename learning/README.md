# Learning Resources

All learning materials, experiments, and tutorial code organized by topic.

## Directory Structure

- **computer_vision/** - OpenCV, HSV filtering, stereo vision, camera calibration
- **machine_learning/** - Neural networks, reinforcement learning, model training
- **openscad/** - CAD design tutorials, 3D modeling for robot parts
- **hardware_design/** - Electronics, PCB design, circuit prototyping
- **navigation/** - Path planning, obstacle avoidance, SLAM
- **sensor_fusion/** - Combining data from multiple sensors
- **voice_control/** - Speech recognition, audio processing

## Philosophy

This is your **learning workspace**:
- Experiment freely
- Try new ideas
- Break things
- Take notes
- Keep tutorial code

Production-ready code goes in:
- ../src/ for Python code
- ../hardware/ for CAD files

## Usage

Each subdirectory can have:
- README.md - Notes on what you learned
- experiments/ - Quick tests
- tutorials/ - Following along with courses
- notes.md - Written observations
